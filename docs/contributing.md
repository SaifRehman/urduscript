# Contributing

The goal of UrduScript is to make programming more accessible to beginners from South Asia. 

There are two ways to contribute.

## Contribute to Grammar

UrduScript uses informal Urdu analogies to programming concepts, making it easy to get started without remembering keywords.

With that in mind. If you have suggestion for a keyword (Like "true" should be "sach"). Please [record it here](https://goo.gl/forms/2yU3xylEoKAQZrbG2). I will add your name to the contributors if I use your suggestion. Thanks!



## Contribute to Code

The [code](https://github.com/asadm/urduscript) is a proof of concept right now. I will put up more instructions on how things work. This section is *TODO*
